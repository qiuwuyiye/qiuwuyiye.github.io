# Programming

&emsp;&emsp;I'm a graduate student of Institute of Computing Technology.

&emsp;&emsp;I didn't really start programming before I became a College student. Now, I have been working with several   students in the lab to develop a graphic machine learning platform which is call BDA Studio. It's full of challenge, but it's an interesting and promising project. If you want to know more about it, you can go to BDA Studio for more information.

&emsp;&emsp;Python is my favourite language, whose simplicity and powerfulness fascinates me. C++ is great, actually it's the first programming language that i have learned. Scala is a new language which is very friendly and is very helpful when i'm programming on spark platform, i enjoy using it but it's far from skilled.

# Internship

&emsp;&emsp;I had an internship at Baidu company in Fcr_model which is responsible for the performance of  CTR(click through rate) model used on Baidu's online advertising system and is is undoubtedly one of the  heart department. I was mainly engaged in feature surveying, feature extraction, model evaluation tasks in the department, one of the model i participated in was finally put in use on the Baidu Advertising System. It's the first internship for me, i have learned a lot about big data processing techniques (like hadoop and map reduce) and feature engineerings.

# Hobbies

&emsp;&emsp;I usually play  badminton, table tennis, i also like swimming. And i'm fond of photography, especially Portrait Photography.
